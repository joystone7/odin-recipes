    <h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare Ingredients:</strong> 
    <p>Gather all the ingredients and chop the vegetables (tomatoes, onions, bell peppers). Rinse the rice under cold water.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Blend Tomatoes and Peppers:</strong>
    <p>In a blender, combine tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers. Blend until smooth to create the base sauce.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Sauté Onions, Garlic, and Ginger:</strong>
    <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot. Sauté chopped onions, minced garlic, and grated ginger until fragrant.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Add Tomato Paste and Seasonings:</strong>
    <p>Stir in tomato paste and cook for a few minutes. Add thyme, bay leaves, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Pour in Blended Sauce:</strong>
    <p>Pour the blended tomato and pepper mixture into the pot. Allow it to simmer and reduce until the sauce thickens.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Add Rice and Stock:</strong>
    <p>Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir to coat it in the sauce. Pour in the stock or broth, ensuring it covers the rice.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong>
    <p>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and simmer on low heat. Allow the rice to absorb the liquid and cook until tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</p></li>
