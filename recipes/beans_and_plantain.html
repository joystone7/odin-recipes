    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Black-eyed Peas</li>
        <li>Ripe Plantains</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Chili Peppers</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Spices (salt, black pepper, thyme or bay leaves)</li>
        <li>Stock or Water</li>
        <li>Optional Additions (bell peppers, ginger, or traditional Ghanaian spices)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
<li><strong>Prepare the Black-eyed Peas:</strong>
<p>Soak the black-eyed peas in water overnight or for several hours to soften them. Rinse them thoroughly.</p></li>

<li><strong>Cook the Black-eyed Peas:</strong>
<p>In a pot, add the soaked and rinsed black-eyed peas. Cover with water or stock, and cook until the peas are tender. This can take approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p></li>

<li><strong>Prepare the Plantains:</strong>
<p>If frying, heat vegetable oil in a pan. Slice the ripe plantains and fry until golden brown on both sides. If boiling, add the plantain slices to the pot with the beans during the last 15-20 minutes of cooking.</p></li>

<li><strong>Sauté Onions, Tomatoes, Garlic, and Chili Peppers:</strong>
<p>In a separate pan, heat vegetable oil. Sauté chopped onions until translucent, then add diced tomatoes, minced garlic, and chili peppers (if using). Cook until the tomatoes break down and the mixture forms a thick sauce.</p></li>

<li><strong>Combine Beans and Plantains:</strong>
<p>Once the black-eyed peas are tender, add the sautéed onion and tomato mixture to the pot. Stir well to combine. If boiling the plantains separately, add them at this stage.</p></li>

<li><strong>Season and Simmer:</strong>
<p>Season the mixture with salt, black pepper, and any additional spices to taste. Allow the beans and plantains to simmer together for an additional 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</p></li>

<li><strong>Adjust Seasoning:</strong>
<p>Taste the dish and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add more salt or spices according to your preference.</p></li>

<li><strong>Serve:</strong>
<p>Once the beans and plantains are well-cooked and seasoned, serve the dish hot. It can be enjoyed on its own or with a side of rice, bread, or a traditional Ghanaian accompaniment.</p></li>
